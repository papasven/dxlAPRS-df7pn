dxlAPRS is Free Software toolchain to operate APRS(r). The toolchain contains:
- afskmodem	soundmodem for 300-19200bd afsk/fsk modulation, 2 channels
- aprsmap	powerful aprs-viewer using open street map
- gps2aprs	aprs-tracker using connected gps-mouse
- gps2digipos	generate pos-beacon for digi/igate using connected gps
- sondemod	decode data produced by a RS92 wx-sonde, received with sondeudp
- sondeudp	soundmodem for RS92 wx-sonde
- udpbox	intelligent aprs-digipeater
- udpflex	interface between serial RMNC/KISS and AXUDP
- udpgate4	aprs-igate
- udphub	L2-switch for AX25, one AXUDP port from a digipeater interfaced
		to many users
- udprfnet

The whole toolchain is copyrighted by Christian Rabler (oe5dxl) and many others
who contributed code (see the actual source code and the git commit messages 
for details). You can redistribute dxlAPRS toolchain and/or modify it under 
the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published by the 
Free Software Foundation. Most of it can also be distributed, at your option,
under any later version of the GNU General Public License -- see individual
files for exceptions.

Also note that the GPL and the other licenses are copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation and other organizations, but the instance of code that they
refer to (the dxlAPRS toolchain source code) is copyrighted by me and others
who actually wrote it.

Like many other projects, dxlAPRS toolchain has a tradition of including big
blocks of License headers in all files. This not only blows up the source code
with mostly redundant information, but also makes it very difficult to generate
License Clearing Reports. An additional problem is that even the same licenses
are referred to by a number of slightly varying text blocks (full, abbreviated,
different indentation, line wrapping and/or white space, with obsolete address
information, ...) which makes automatic processing a nightmare.

To make this easier, such license headers in the source files will be replaced 
with a single line reference to Unique License Identifiers as defined by the 
Linux Foundation's SPDX project [1]. For example, in a source file the full 
"GPL v2.0 or later" header text will be replaced by a single line:

	SPDX-License-Identifier:	GPL-2.0+

Ideally, the license terms of all files in the source tree should be defined by
such License Identifiers; in no case a file can contain more than one such 
License Identifier list.

If a "SPDX-License-Identifier:" line references more than one Unique License 
Identifier, then this means that the respective file can be used under the 
terms of either of these licenses, i. e. with

	SPDX-License-Identifier:	GPL-2.0+	BSD-3-Clause

you can chose between GPL-2.0+ and BSD-3-Clause licensing.

We use the SPDX Unique License Identifiers here; these are available
at [2].
