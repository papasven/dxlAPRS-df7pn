|7315 Filter out all received from Igate

|7320 Filter out Object/Call seen on Map
* is wildcard

|7400 Enter Your Callsign, it is not necessary
to receive data from servers but would
be nice to show the makers of servers
who is online. If You run more active
Aprs tools, each should have a different
SSID at Your Call like -1 -2 ...
 

|7405 Choose a Symbol, avoid storm, fire and
other alarm symbols as static beacon.
For Overlay Symbol an additional
Character or Number may be choosed

|7406 choose a Symbol on the
Table and click to enter

|7410 Click to open Editor, Move and Zoom Map
(zoomlevel 15 or more) to Your Position
and Shift-Leftclick to the Map. You get
a Position that may be Edited before Add.
Do not move delete or add characters.

|7415 Net Beacon needs only the Comment like
Name, QRV on 145.500Mhz

\\h \\z \\v \\<file> for inserting time,
program version or a file
\\!wx.csv,,,t,,,,,h,b,r,w,d,,,,,g!
 insert wx values from csv file
 filename t=temp h=hygro b=baro g=gust(km/h)
 w=wind(km/h) d=winddir L=lum r=rain1h(mm)
 P=rain24h(mm) p=raintoday(mm)
 use ,w3.6, multiplier if given in m/s


|7420 Enter a valid Passcode and enable
"Allow Tx to Net" if You want
to send Data to AprsIs Network
(beacons/objects/messages/acks)

|7425 enter AprsIs-Server-URLs like
"nuremberg.aprs2.net:14580" or
IP-number and if not default
port 14580 append ":port".
IF more Servers are entered and
enabled they will be tried until
one is working.


|7430 Enter a filter for receive data from AprsIs Network
m/200 or center/radius or a lot of call filters are possible

|7435 Enable or Disable Connection to AprsIs Network

|7440 Sending Net Beacons or Send and Ack Messages
makes only sense with a valid passcode.
With a "m/..." Serverfilter your Position
should be sent to the Server even without
a valid passcode to tell the Server Your
Position. Without a valid Passcode the 
Data will not go to the World 

|7445 Enable Igate
In Win version works only with Servers with ping-pong
protocoll extension (udpgate) due to TCP-System
is not able to report DELAY time on transmission
and can not stop a delaying link without trying to
send the timed out Data, known as "sending data into
a hole in wall problem". This would draw disrupted-
and ghost-tracks on Maps.

|7446 Choose Rf-Ports to be gated to
Internet if gateing is Enabled
e.g. 124 for Port 1 2 and 4

|7500 Enable/Disable Rf Port 1

|7501 Enter an UDP-IP-number with Port
Pair to Send and Receive Data from
a (kiss/smack) TNC (with udpflex as
interface) or a Soundmodem.
127.0.0.1:9001:9002 with IP:tx:rx
a 0 port will disable this direction.
If not want to Listen to other IP-numbers
as send to, write tx/rx instead of tx:rx
No ip number for same computer ":9001:9002"
An optional Port Name may be appended

|7505 Same as Port 1
|7506 Same as Port 1
|7510 Same as Port 1
|7511 Same as Port 1
|7515 Same as Port 1
|7516 Same as Port 1

|7520 Start/Stop Serial Interface/Soundmodem Task
|7521 Enter Name and Parameters of a Program for interface
UDP ports to Serial Ports or Soundmodem.
example (unix/win): (or use a ".BAT" file for more ports)

tnc2/tf/smack:
 udpflex.exe -U 127.0.0.1:9002:9001 -k -s -t com1:9600

tmd710/th-d72/kiss/USB:
 udpflex.exe -U :9002:9001 -i kiss.txt -u -t com3:9600

dire-wolf soundmodem:
 udpflex.exe -U :9002:9001 -T :

example (unix):
 afskmodem -f 22050 -C 0 -p /dev/ttyS0 0 -M 0 -U 127.0.0.1:9002:9001 -m 0

try the line before in a dos-terminal with -h or -v option

|7525 Same as Serial 1
|7526 Same as Serial 1
example (win) Your GPS to Map: (see more options gps2aprs -h)
 gps2aprs.exe -t com1:4800 -I OE0AAA -D -0 30 -b 2 -r 127.0.0.1:9002 

|7530 If enabled, all frames with not a valid
"callsign" as sender will be discarded
Also used as not-call-Beacon Send warning.
|7531 If enabled, all frames with not a valid
"callsign" as sender will be discarded
Also used as not-call-Beacon Send warning.

|7535 Switch On/Off showing a Ticker Headline
of received and sent Callsigns 

|7536 Number of shown Callsigns in Window Title
0 show new Calls only, 1 call with time.

Linux hint:Some Windowmakers seem to not
free memory of old headline entries so,
if RAM is small, use 0 or option off. 

|7537 Configure Rf to Rf and Net to Rf Digipeating

|7540 Beacon/Object editor 

|7545 If two Beacons (especially with same Text) are
sent in that Time Igate delete dupes (57s), You
will never see the Beacon in AprsIs Network
even if sent on different Frequecys.
To avoid this, the Shift Time is used
to spread Transmissions over the Time.

|7550 What to do if a Message or Query arrives
and config reply/send message Path

|7695 Enable/Disable the Line. Disabled lines do
nothing but wait for being reenable later

|7696 Delete Line, the text is copied to
edit line for changes and Add

|7706 Enter beacon time in seconds (600 is widely used)
or 0 to send Netbeacon only at start of connection.
Sending 1 Netbeacon makes sense even with no
Passcode to tell the Server Your position
for usage of m/... filters

|7701 Minutes to Hold Objects and Items in RAM then Purge
except with WX-Data to have fulltime WX-Graphs

|7700 Minutes hold any Data in RAM then Purge
This is the maximum "Show Fullbright" Time too
 
|7705 Minutes Show Symbols and Tracks on Screen

|7704 Minutes Fading out Symbols and Tracks
after Full Bright Time on Screen

|7703 Seconds Show km/h after last move

|7702 Minutes back from now try to detect
double received waypoints and filter

change by click to map

|7708 delay in animation/video before
speedup if no one moves

|7709 Shift System Time by up to +-24h in 
shown times. Log times are not affected.

|7745 After moving and zooming the Map, wait this
Time befor starting missing Map Download if
not want to Load fine zoomed strips along a
Map moving way.   

|7860 If enabled show Lat/Long and QTH-Locator of
Mouse Position, Distance and Direction to

Hint: "Config > Reload Config" (re)reads
this files after changes.
Press "Save Config" before.

|7855 Enable Trackfilter to remove possibly wrong waypoints
of tracks. This does not affect stored data.

|7850 If enabled, missing map-parts are tried to be
downloaded by writing "gettiles" file. A task
that reads this file may get the parts of map
from internet in background. What arrives
within 30s will be updated on screen otherwise
updates by next activity in map

|7851 Program Name and Parameters to be started
if Map Download is requested. The Program
reads "gettiles" file, loads maps and if
done, deletes "gettiles" file.

|7845 Show a Scaler on the map. A small
Zoomlevel would distort distances
so Scaler will not be shown.
 
|7840 If enabled, and data avaliable,
show a driving direction arrow.

|7835 If enabled, and data avaliable,
show a windvane at WX-Symbols

|7830 If enabled, and data avaliable,

|7920 window size used on next program start
updated as window size is changed

|7917 Design and switch on/off event sounds 

|7915 "move Map" or "move Window over Map"
according to Cursor Key Arrows

|7910 If a part of Map is not in the Map-Cache, allow to
double size of yet avaliable lower resolution part until
the part is loaded from a Map server. You will see a
red Button during this Mode

|7905 If a selected object gets to be zoomed to
fit in screen, zooming is done as far as
Maps in full resolution are in Cache else 
You get a black map and, if enabled,
download starts

|7900 Enable to get a message if an object
approaches and is in the configured
radius. A file "proxwarn" contains call
an distance for an external program

|7901 Enter Radius for Approxymation Message
If a Station moves toward You, a File
"proxwarn" will be generated with Call
and Distance for a Speech Program

To start Beaconing by timer, enable the line
with On/Off-button.

|8101 Draw on local Map for testing. Hold Shift
and click to Map to change Position or press "x".
Delete on Map with click to symbol and DEL-Key.

|8102 Send edited Beacon immediately to Rf or
Net Port as configured. Use for sending
"Delete Objects" one time on Net

|8103 Cancel edit window to see more Lines
of Schedule Table.

|8104 Exit Beacon editor

|8110 Make default (mostly empty) edit Lines
With click to a Symbol on map the Data
will be cloned and may be edited to make
your own beacon out of.  
|8111 Close Beacon editor
 
|8115 For "Beacons" this should be one of your
Calls + ssid. The Position is fixed as 
configured in Config > Online > My Position
For Items an Objects this is the Name
seen by the Symbol on Map. This need not
be a Callsign.

|8120 Position for Items and Objects in DDMM.MMM
or D.DDDDD or :File containing Position or
simply hold SHIFT Key and click on the Map.
To quick reposit Objects: "B" to open Beacon

|8124 Time between 2 beacons in Seconds. 
Additional each Beacon in scheduler is shifted
from each other by
Config > Rf-Ports > Beacon Shift Time
because same beacons will be deleted by Igates
if seen before at less than 27s to 1 minute.
If sending beacons to Net and same time to rf,
you will never see who received it.

|8126 Radio Path, like WIDE2-2 or, if the Digis
in Your area are configured correct, simpley
use -1 or -2 which will be appended to the 
Destination Call to do same es WIDE but with
zero bytes overhead.

|8128 Enter Altitude in m over NN or negative
for below. Only positive values in
Compressed Mode. This will take some
Bytes more except in Compressed Mode
with no speed/direction.

|8130 Speed in km/h

|8132 Course in 0..359 degrees

|8134 Choose Symbol and if You know what
You do enter overlay Symbols here.

|8136 Destination "Call" is generated automatic
in Mic-e Mode else is used as hint to which
hard/software is used. If desired, Append a
SSID in "Via Path" like "-1".

|8138 Click at a Symbol in the Thumbnail Picture

|8140 Set Type "Beacon", to send Symbol and Info
with your Position and Call with SSID. The
Symbol has the Call as Label and possibly
Altitute and Speed or Wx Data.

|8141 Set Type "Object" with HHMMSS Timestamp.
Send Object to set Symbol and object Name
to other as your Position. The Symbol shows
the Object Name (need not be a Callsign) as
label.

|8142 Set Type "Object" with DDHHMM Timestamp. 

|8143 Set Type "Item". This is like "Object"
but witout Timestamp and needs less bytes
with short Name and compressed position.
On Rf prefer this if no Time info needed.
If Message editor (M) is open, a Copy of
the Item will be ready to transmit as Item
Message.  

|8144 Set Type "Delete Item". This wipes out
Items with This Name on all Maps. 
Important: Tx only once on Net or manual
a view times on Rf Ports.

|8145 Set Type "Delete Object". Depending on
Viewer should delete Items too.
 
|8150 Send normal DDMM.MM format, long, only
18m resolution but man-readable. May
be extendet with DAO to 20cm resolution
with "Lat/Long+" and 5 bytes more.

|8151 Send Mic-e format, this is compressed to
minimal size with 18m resolution and no
extra bytes for speed and course. May
contain not-printable characters so be
carefull by copy/edit raw data. May be
extendet with DAO to 20cm resolution
with "Mic-e+" and 5 Bytes more.

For Objects and Items enable Multiline Editing
Shift + Leftclick or "x" on Map to Add Lines.
When first Line is entered a "fine configure"
Submenue will Open. Switch to "Lat/Long" to
reposit whole Object with Shift Click or "x"


|8152 Send "Compressed" format, this is fixed size
and may contain speed/course OR (positive)
altitude but not both. If needs both, the
long /A=...... extention will be appended.
Resolution is 30cm

|8153 Same as "Lat/Long" but with DAO extention
if you need finer resolution than 18m.

|8154 Same as "Mic-e" but with DAO extention
if you need finer resolution than 18m.

|8160 Sent Beacon to AprsIs on TCPIP Net.
"Via Path" is not needed here.
|8161 Send Beacon to Radio Port 1 as configured
and enabled in "Config > Rf-Ports"
|8162 Send Beacon to Radio Port 2 as configured

|8164 Send Beacon to Radio Port 4 as configured
and enabled in "Config > Rf-Ports"
 


|8170 Port:Time:rawtext
Yellow Field is a "delete object" so if sent
i will wipe out the object/item on all maps.
Red Field contains any error and should not
be transmitted.

|8205 if stay on Rf use "RFONLY" or "NOGATE" else the
software-ID "APLM01" or some other valid string.
On Net always software-ID is used.

|8210 Empty string for direkt
number for SSID-Routing "2" makes -2 to destination call
or some old chunk like "RELAY" "WIDE"...

|8220 Show (not ack) Messages to My Call but other SSID too
|8225 Show Messages from/to same Call and
same SSID (Telemetry Headlines)





|8305 Make a new Digi. If same Line does not exist
yet, a new Line will be stored. Adjust
in/out-port and behavior at the stored
Line. Every digi Line does digipeating
from one input port (rx) to output port
(tx). This may be same port or another
(crossband digi). More Lines may share
same input and output port, the Dupe
-filter, sitting on output port eliminates
automatic double transmissions of same
content. It is also possible to have more
Rx sending UDP to one input port, eg.
listening soundmodems every 50hz on SW
or more Rx for Antenna-Diversity. 

|8306 Store Digi Line at the place where
clicked "Edit" before (dimmed Line). 

|8310 Enter Words/Calls that should not be
digipeated if in source/destination
or via-Field like "NOCALL". <mycall>"
in the "done" via path is always
filtert out because it was repeated
by You just before.
"i" excludes <mycall> from digipeating
in the active path.
"-" switches off the powerfull SSID
-Routing. This should only be done in
a crossband Digi from SW to VHF because
on SW the "NOGATE" and "RFONLY"
-Mechanism is (still) working but not
so on VHF. Some misconfigured igates
may copy Your digipeated SW-data to
Internet. (SSID-Routing is done by
SSID on Destination Call 1..7)


|8315 Enter Words for Digipeating with the
N-n Mode, for Example "WIDE". A
"WIDE2-2" in the next active "via"
will be replaced by "<mycall>*,WIDE2-1".
A "WIDE2-1" migrates to "<mycall>*".
"WIDE2" will not be digipeated here
but may be part of "Via Alias" Line.
"TRACE", "WIDE" or what else will be
treated same way because <mycall>
is always appended to (done) Path.

For gate Net-to-Rf this line contains
max. Bit/s and optional VIA path like
"20 WIDE1-1" negative Bit/s will only
gate Messages to on send-port heard Users.
 

|8320 Enter Words or Calls for Digipeating
which will be replaced by <mycall>*
<mycall> is automatic part of this
Line if not switched off with "i" 
in Block-Field. Common words are
"RELAY" "WIDE" "ECHO" and for
crossband digipeating from SW use
"GATE" as the only word in Line.

|8325 Limit Radius of digipeated Data. This
is the Distance of the Beacon-sending
-station to You. A 0 disables this, a
"30000" means the whole earth but makes
sense because all non-position junk will
be filtert out except of messages,
they will always be digipeated.

|8330 This is a Powerful trafic-reduction mechanism.
If set to eg. 29 Minutes (1740s) it will
filter out all Beacons with same Content for
this Period. (Repeatedly sent) messages pass
(after the internal fixed minimum time of 27s).
Moving- and Weather-Stations will have
different content so pass always.
Values less than 27s will be replaced by 27s,
this is standard to avoid rotating beacons.

|8335 Toggle On/Off this Line, a not green
dot line does nothing.
Switch on only if Your KISS TNC/Serial
Line never looses Bytes else Your Digi
will spread wrong Positions seen on
whole world. With normal (not USB)
com-port use only with SMACK CRC.

|8336 Cycle thru possible Input (rx)
"Rf-Ports". "N" is for gate Net to Rf,
"*" listens on All Ports except Net.

|8337 Cycle thru possible output (tx) "Rf-Ports"

|8338 If enabled, only "direct heard" (First digi in chain)
Beacons will be digipeated. Since most digi-paths are
discarded or destroyed by other digis, this does not
work any more. It would dramatically reduce traffic
and make a high efficient, low-noise (home) Digi.

|8339 If enabled the still not active rest of via-path
will be cut off at retransmission. This reduces
own "noise" by shorter frames and a lot of
network noise because the beacon is not further
digipeated (Last digi in chain).
This may be helful to bring things INTO a local area
if no (eg) 70cm Port is avaliable to do this better.

|8340 Edit this part with "Edit" Function and Restore.

|8350 Quick On/Off Digi.
Inactive Lines may be preserved for later use

|8351 Input (Rx) Rf-Port or "N" Net source to Rf Gate

|8352 Output (Tx) Rf-Port
|8353 Use Direct Heard only (direct heard is not detectable any longer) 
|8354 Cut off rest of via path

|8355 Dupe Time in seconds, 840s (14Min) is good value
In this Time Beacons with always same content will 
be digipeated only once.

|8356 Radius in km around You will be digipeated

|8360 Copy this Line to editor Field for viewing
or modify and Restore or Add for a New digi Line.


|8430 1st Value: Brightness of white Lines showing Rf-Paths
in "Heard" and "+Rf" Mode.


|8440 Enter Fontheight, Range 7..24 Pixel Fontwidth
Range 6..12 if File "font[width].png" is
avaliable. "14 8" will load font8.png and
zoom it to heigth 14.
Or enter Heigth and Your Fontfile like
"20 font-bold.png"
A third percent value zooms Symbols according
to Fontheight (default 140)


|8435 Toggle on/off Transparent Menus

|8450 click to choose a colour

|8529 Antenna at Marker 1 Altitude over Ground.
If " A" is appended like "10 A", the
Altitude (if avaliable) from a clicked
Object will be added
For calculating RF-Illumination apply a Line:
<m> <azimuth 0..360> <elevation -90..90>
<sum of tx,rx Antenna Gain + tx Power in dBm>
<Antennadiagram Filename>
eg. "10 270 0 74 antennas/myantenne.ant"

|8527 Antenna at Marker 2 Altitude over Ground.
3 Antenna-RF-Illumination like Marker 1

|8525 Antenna 3 is used for Radio Range Map
(shortcut R) as receiver for radiation
of Antenna 1 and optional Antenna 2 for
a Reflection Areas Map of optical sight.
Mixed Colour Areas show possible places
for Repeaters. Set to 0m for natural
Reflektors. Where areas Touch, there
might be a Diffraction Line. 

|8520 Frequency for Fresnelzone.
The zone is calculated 3-dimensional
to see obstacles under and beside of
Radiation
For calculating RF-Illumination apply
the Line: <MHz> <min dBm> <max dBm>
so min to max dBm at rx antenna will
be mapped to min..max white or colour
luminosity. eg. "2400 -90 -60"

|8518 Refraction Factor of Atmosphere
0.00 in Vacuum
1.00 Vacuum on Flat Earth or refraction equals earthradius
0.25 Typical Value in Atmosphere

|8515 0 is hard shaped area. More realistic
Image will make values around 5 to 10
(meters) for soft fading away sight.
Values from 20 to more hundred meters
(in high mountain areas) are usefull
for calculating relief-Maps as overlay
to OSM Maps or with zero-brigthness Map.
Set Marker 1 (and optional 2) as "light
source" to 100 or more 1000 meters high
and nice colours, 100% brightness and
press "R"

|8508 Cache for altitude data in RAM in Megabytes
Set to more for faster work with altitude Maps
or long distance radiation sight graphs

|8505 Colour of Radiation Area from Antenna 1

|8500 Colour of Radiation Area from Antenna 2
Where both antennas have sight, the two colours will
be mixed to a third colour which shows possible
reflection areas. Where the 2 colours get in touch
there may be a diffraction edge

|8535 Select Quality
|8536 Redraw if quality changed
